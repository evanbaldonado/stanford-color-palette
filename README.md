# Stanford University's Color Palette

Disclaimer: This color palette is from Stanford University's [Identity Guide](https://identity.stanford.edu/design-elements/color/) and is intended for use only with Stanford-related projects. I did not create this color palette myself; rather, I stored the palette's colors as variables in a [CSS file](stanford-color-palette.css) as part of my work for a Stanford-affiliated summer job. For any comments or concerns, please email [stanford@evanbaldonado.com](mailto:stanford@evanbaldonado.com).
